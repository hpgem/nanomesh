## Generate a 2D triangular mesh

This notebook shows how to mesh a 2D image:

1. Load and visualize a volume
2. Select a plane from a volume
3. Apply image filters and segment an image
4. Generate a 2D triangle mesh
5. Visualize and export the mesh to other formats


### Load and vizualize the data

This example uses nanopore sample data from `nanomesh.data`.

If you want to use your own data, any numpy array can be passed to into a [`Volume`](https://nanomesh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nanomesh.volume.html#nanomesh.volume.Volume) object. Data stored as `.npy` can be loaded using `Volume.load()`.

```python
from nanomesh import Image
from nanomesh.data import nanopores3d

data = nanopores3d()

vol = Image(data)
vol.show_slice()
```

Nanomesh makes use of [`itkwidgets`](https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/itkwidgets) to render the volumes.

```python
vol.show()
```

There is also a simple `matplotlib` based viewer to plot the slices of the volume. The sliders can be used to select different directions and slice numbers. Optionally, the index of the first slice can be specified directly using, for example, `x=123`.

```python
vol.show_slice(x=123)
```

### Select plane from volume

Select single plane from the volume using the `.select_volume` method. In this case, we select slice #161 along the x-axis. The slice is loaded into a [`Plane`](https://nanomesh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nanomesh.image.html#nanomesh.image.Plane) object.

```python
plane = vol.select_plane(x=161)
plane.show()
```

### Filter and segment the data

Image segmentation is a way to label the pixels of different regions of interest in an image. In this example, we are interested in separating the bulk material (Si) from the nanopores. In the image, the Si is bright, and the pores are dark.

First, we apply a [`gaussian filter`](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.filters.html#skimage.filters.gaussian) to smooth out some of the image noise to get a cleaner segmentation.

**Note**: The code below is essentially short-hand for `plane_gauss = plane.apply(skimage.filters.gaussian, sigma=5)`. `apply` can be used for any operation that works on an array, i.e. from `numpy`, `scipy.ndimage` or `scikit-image`. If the output is a numpy array of the same dimensions, a `Image` object is returned. Anything else, and it will return the direct result of the function.

```python
plane_gauss = plane.gaussian(sigma=5)
plane_gauss.show()
```

Use the `compare_with_other` method to check out the difference:

```python
plane.compare_with_other(plane_gauss)
```

`scikit-image` contains a useful function to [try all threshold finders on the data](https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/api/skimage.filters.html#skimage.filters.try_all_threshold). These methods analyse the contrast histogram and try to find the optimal value to separate which parts of the image belong to each domain. The method below is a shortcut to this function.

Note that it is always possible to define your own threshold.

```python
plane_gauss.try_all_threshold(figsize=(5, 10))
```

We continue with the `li` method, because it gives a result with nice separation.

```python
thresh = plane_gauss.threshold('li')
thresh
```

Check how the segmented image compares to the original.

```python
segmented = plane_gauss.digitize(bins=[thresh])
plane.compare_with_digitized(segmented)
```

### Generate mesh


Meshes are generated using the `Mesher2D` class. Meshing consists of two steps:

1. Contour finding (using the [`find_contours`](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.measure.html#skimage.measure.find_contours) function
2. Triangulation (using the [`triangle`](https://rufat.be/triangle/) library)

Contour finding uses the [marching cubes algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_cubes) to wrap all the pores in a polygon. `max_edge_dist=5` splits up long edges in the contour, so that no two points are further than 5 pixels apart. `level` is directly passed to `find_contours` and specifies the level at which the contour is generated. In this case, we set it to the threshold value determined above.

```python tags=[]
from nanomesh import Mesher2D

mesher = Mesher2D(plane_gauss)
mesher.generate_contour(max_edge_dist=5, level=thresh)

mesher.plot_contour()
```

The next step is to use the contours to initialize triangulation.

Triangulation options can be specified through the `opts` keyword argument. This example uses `q30` to generate a quality mesh with angles > 30Â°, and `a100` to set a maximum triangle size of 100 pixels. For more options, see [here](https://rufat.be/triangle/API.html#triangle.triangulate).

```python
mesh = mesher.triangulate(opts='q30a100')
```

Triangulation returns a `MeshContainer` dataclass that can be used for various operations, for example comparing it with the original image:

```python
plane_gauss.compare_with_mesh(mesh)
```

Or, showing the an interactive plot using pyvista:

(Use `.plot_itk()` for an interactive view)

```python
mesh.plot_pyvista(jupyter_backend='static', show_edges=True)
```

### Field data

Field data can be used to associate names with the values in the cell data. These are shown in the legend of mesh data (i.e. in the plots above). The field data is stored in the `.field_data` attribute. Because the data are somewhat difficult to use in this state, the properties `.field_to_number` and `.number_to_field` can be used to access the mapping per cell type.

```python
mesh.number_to_field
```

To update the values, you can update `.field_data` directory, or use `.set_field_data`. Note that field names are shared between cell types. For example, to relabel the cells data:



```python
mesh.set_field_data('triangle', {1: 'Silicon', 2: 'Pore'})
```

Plotting the mesh now shows the fields in the legend. Note that the fields are also saved when exported to a format that supports them (e.g. gmsh).

```python
mesh.plot(lw=1, color_map={0: 'lightgray'})
```

### Interoperability

The `MeshContainer` object can also be used to convert to various other library formats, such as:

- [`trimesh.Trimesh`](https://trimsh.org/trimesh.base.html#trimesh.base.Trimesh)
- [`pyvista.UnstructuredGrid`](https://docs.pyvista.org/examples/00-load/create-unstructured-surface.html)
- [`meshio.Mesh`](https://docs.pyvista.org/examples/00-load/create-unstructured-surface.html)

First, we must extract the triangle data:

```python
triangle_mesh = mesh.get('triangle')

pv_mesh = triangle_mesh.to_pyvista_unstructured_grid()
trimesh_mesh = triangle_mesh.to_trimesh()
meshio_mesh = triangle_mesh.to_meshio()
```

To save the data, use the `.write` method. This is essentially a very thin wrapper around `meshio`, equivalent to `meshio.write(...)`.

```python
mesh.write('out.msh', file_format='gmsh22', binary=False)
```
